    description: 'Dal Tadka is the dish that millions of Indians eat multiple times a week. Simple, nourishing yellow lentils finished with a dramatic tempering of ghee, cumin, garlic, and chilies. It is the definitive starting point for cooking Indian food.',
    story: 'Dal tadka is what a tired parent makes on a weeknight and what a restaurant puts on its menu as a point of pride. The "tadka" (tempering) at the end is the magic — hot ghee sizzling with spices poured over the cooked lentils at the last moment.',
    whatItTastes: 'Warm, comforting, earthy, and deeply savory with a gentle spice. The ghee and garlic tempering gives it an irresistible aroma. Simple but deeply satisfying.',
    ingredients: [

      { amount: '1 medium', item: 'tomato', note: 'chopped' },
      { amount: '—', item: 'For the Tadka (Tempering):' },

      { amount: '½ tsp', item: 'red chili powder' },
      { amount: '—', item: 'fresh cilantro', note: 'for garnish' }
    ],
    steps: [
      {
        step: 1,
        title: 'Rinse and cook the dal',
        instruction: 'Rinse toor dal in cold water 2–3 times until the water runs mostly clear. Add to a medium pot with 3 cups of water, turmeric, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off any foam that rises. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 25–30 minutes until the lentils are completely soft and starting to break apart. If using a pressure cooker: 3–4 whistles on medium heat. Add the chopped tomato in the last 10 minutes of cooking.'
      },
      {
        step: 2,
        title: 'Mash the dal',
        instruction: 'Once the dal is fully cooked and the tomatoes are soft, use a whisk or the back of a spoon to mash it to a semi-smooth consistency. Add water to adjust — the dal should be pourable, roughly the consistency of a thick soup. Taste and add salt as needed. Keep it on low heat while you make the tadka.'
      },
      {
        step: 3,
        title: 'Make the tadka (this is the important part!)',
        instruction: 'In a small pan or ladle, heat 2 tablespoons of ghee over medium-high heat. When the ghee is shimmering and hot (a drop of water should sizzle immediately), add the cumin seeds. They should splutter and sizzle within a second or two. Then add the sliced garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute until it turns golden (not brown — watch it carefully, it goes fast!). Add the dried red chili and asafoetida (if using) and cook for 15 seconds more.'
      },
      {
        step: 4,
        title: 'Add the chili powder and pour',
        instruction: 'Remove the pan from the heat briefly, add the red chili powder (off heat so it doesn\'t burn), stir, and then immediately pour the entire sizzling tadka over the dal. The dramatic sizzle and aroma when it hits the dal is the signature moment of this dish. Stir to combine.'
      },
      {
        step: 5,
        title: 'Garnish and serve',
        instruction: 'Squeeze a little lemon juice over the dal (optional but brightens it). Garnish generously with fresh chopped cilantro. Serve immediately with basmati rice or hot roti/naan.'
      }
    ],
    tips: [
      'The tadka must be done in a separate pan and poured over at the end — this is non-negotiable for flavor.',
      'Masoor dal (red lentils) needs no soaking and cooks in 15–20 minutes — great for busy weeknights.',
      'If garlic starts turning dark brown, reduce heat. Dark brown = fine; black = burned.',
      'Leftovers thicken considerably in the fridge — add water when reheating.'
    ],
    serving: 'Serve with steamed basmati rice for a complete meal. Also wonderful with hot roti or naan. A side of mango pickle and a dollop of yogurt complete the meal.',

    story: 'A Punjabi classic, palak paneer took its place as India\'s most recognized vegetarian curry. The contrast of rich, creamy spinach with mild, slightly firm paneer is perfectly balanced. Good palak paneer should be green, not grey — the color tells you everything.',

Immediately drain and transfer to a bowl of ice water (or very cold water) to stop the cooking. This preserves the vibrant green color. Drain again after 2 minutes. Blend the cooled spinach to a smooth puree. Set aside.'
      },

        step: 2,

        instruction: 'In a wide pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Add the paneer cubes and fry on each side for 1–2 minutes until golden. Remove and set aside. This step gives the paneer a better texture and slight flavor, though you can skip it if short on time.'
      },
      {
        step: 3,
        title: 'Build the base',
        instruction: 'In the same pan, heat another tablespoon of oil or ghee. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for 30 seconds. Add the onion and cook over medium heat, stirring often, for 8–10 minutes until golden brown. This longer cooking of onion is important for flavor — don\'t rush it. Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the raw smell is gone.'
      },
      {
        step: 4,
        title: 'Add tomatoes and spices',
        instruction: 'Add the chopped tomatoes, turmeric, coriander powder, and red chili powder. Cook over medium heat for 5–7 minutes, stirring often, until tomatoes break down completely and the oil separates from the masala — you\'ll see the sides of the pan becoming oil-glossy. This is the sign the base is cooked properly.'
      },
      {
        step: 5,
        title: 'Combine and finish',
        instruction: 'Add the spinach puree and stir to combine with the masala. Add ¼ cup water to adjust consistency. Simmer on low heat for 5 minutes. Add the paneer cubes, stir gently, and simmer for 3–4 more minutes. Stir in the cream. Crush the kasuri methi between your palms and add it — this is what gives it that restaurant flavor. Add garam masala, taste and adjust salt. Simmer 2 more minutes.'

    tips: [
      'The ice bath after blanching is the key to vibrant green color — don\'t skip it.',
      'The oil separating from the masala (called "bhunna") tells you the base is fully cooked.',

    story: 'This is the curry of dhabas (roadside eateries) and food stalls across India, eaten with puffed bhature bread or rice. Good chana masala should be dark, thick, and boldly spiced — not mild or pale.',

Add the finely chopped onions and cook over medium-low heat for 12–15 minutes, stirring regularly. The onions should turn deep golden-brown — this long cooking is the foundation of flavor.

      {
        step: 2,
        title: 'Add tomatoes and dry spices',

Cook over medium heat, stirring regularly, for 8–10 minutes until the tomatoes completely cook down and you see oil separating on the sides. The masala should be thick and almost paste-like at this point.'
      },
      {
        step: 3,
        title: 'Add chickpeas and simmer',
        instruction: 'Add the drained chickpeas and 1 cup of water. Stir everything together and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10–15 minutes. Use the back of a spoon to mash a few chickpeas against the side of the pot — this helps thicken the gravy naturally.'
      },
      {
        step: 4,
        title: 'Season and finish',
        instruction: 'Add the chana masala powder (or garam masala), amchur powder, and remaining garam masala. Stir and taste. The flavor should be bold and tangy. Add salt as needed. Add a little water if the curry is too thick. Simmer for 5 more minutes to let the spices bloom.'

      'Dark, deeply caramelized onions are the secret to restaurant-quality chana masala.',
