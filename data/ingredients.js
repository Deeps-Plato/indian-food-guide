    beginnerTip: 'Start with store-bought ghee (Purity or Amul brands are great). Use just 1–2 tablespoons — it\'s rich. Drizzle a little ghee on hot dal and rice right before eating; it\'s a transformative experience.',
    storage: 'Room temperature up to 3 months, refrigerated up to 1 year.',

    beginnerTip: 'Rinse rice 2–3 times until water runs clear, then soak for 30 minutes. Use a 1:1.5 ratio (rice:water). This removes excess starch and ensures fluffy, separate grains. Never lift the lid while steaming!',

    beginnerTip: 'Pressure cook toor dal for 3–4 whistles or simmer covered for 25–30 minutes until completely soft. Mash it roughly with the back of a spoon — a slightly textured consistency is traditional. Don\'t skip the tempering (tadka) at the end, it\'s the most important step.',

    uses: ['Dal makhani', 'Idli batter', 'Dosa batter', 'Vada', 'Papad'],
    beginnerTip: 'For dal makhani, use whole black urad dal — soak overnight and slow cook. The black skin is where most of the flavor is. For South Indian dishes like idli, use the white split version. These are very different ingredients despite sharing a name.',

    beginnerTip: 'Canned chickpeas are perfectly fine (drain and rinse them). For dried chickpeas: soak overnight, then simmer 1–1.5 hours or pressure cook 4–5 whistles. Tea bags during cooking make the skin darker and more flavorful (as in restaurant chana masala).',

    uses: ['Roti / Chapati', 'Paratha', 'Puri', 'Thepla'],
    beginnerTip: 'The secret to soft roti is resting the dough for at least 30 minutes after kneading. The dough should be soft and slightly tacky — softer than you think. Cook on a very hot dry skillet and press gently with a cloth in the last 30 seconds to puff it up.',

    uses: ['Pakoras', 'Kadhi', 'Cheela (crepes)', 'Besan laddoo', 'Bhajji'],
    beginnerTip: 'Besan must be fully cooked or it tastes raw and bitter. When making kadhi, simmer for at least 20–25 minutes, stirring regularly. For pakora batter, add cold water gradually until you get a thick, coating consistency.',

    uses: ['Tamarind chutney', 'Sambar', 'Rasam', 'Pad Thai (outside India)', 'Chutneys'],
    beginnerTip: 'The easiest form is tamarind concentrate (in a jar) — just add ½–1 tsp dissolved in water. For the block form, break off a small piece, soak in ½ cup hot water for 15 minutes, then squeeze out the paste and discard seeds. The concentrate is much easier for beginners.',

    uses: ['Kerala chicken curry', 'Goan fish curry', 'Malai dishes', 'South Indian curries'],
    beginnerTip: 'Shake the can well before opening — coconut cream separates and settles. Use full-fat for cooking; light coconut milk makes thin curries. Add coconut milk at the end and simmer on low heat — boiling can cause it to curdle.',

    beginnerTip: 'Make a big batch of ginger-garlic paste (equal parts, blended with a little water) and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks or freeze in ice cube trays. Use 1 cube per dish. Cooking garlic in oil for a full minute before adding other ingredients ensures no raw garlic taste.',

    beginnerTip: 'Store cilantro with stems in a glass of water in the fridge, covered loosely with a bag — lasts 1–2 weeks this way. Use the stems too (they\'re more flavorful in cooked dishes, leaves are better raw/garnish). If you\'re one of the people who finds cilantro soapy, try using less.',
